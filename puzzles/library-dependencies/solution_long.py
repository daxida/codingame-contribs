    Checks if there is a cycle and also builds the topological sorting.
    
    Initially I intended to do this but it ended up been easier working backwards:
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting
    https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/topological-sorting-indegree-based-solution/

    Here we work with a heap starting with the independent libraries.
    Then we add the libraries that become independent after we imported
    the previous independent libraries (respecting lexicographical order)

    Working with a heap is not needed and you could pass every test 
    sorting a whole array at each iteration.
